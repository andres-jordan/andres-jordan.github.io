          My current research concentrates on the discovery and characterization of transiting exoplanets, a topic on which I started working while I was a Clay Fellow at the CfA, and on small telescope instrumentation. I'm actively involved in <a href="http://hatsouth.org">HATSouth</a>, a project that has built a global network of southern hemisphere automated wide-field telescopes to detect transiting exoplanets. I was the PI of <a href="http://chat.hatsurveys.org">CHAT</a>, a now retired 0.7m automated telescope dedicated to exoplanet light curve observations at Las Campanas Observatory. We are working on the final stages of commissioning of <a href="http://hatpi.org">HATPI</a>, an innovative instrument of which I am co-PI and that will image the whole sky visible from Las Campanas (above 30 deg elevation) with high photometric precision and a cadence of 30 seconds.

         On the characterization front, I am involved in atmospheric studies, and particularly in using transmission spectroscopy to probe the atmospheric composition of transiting exoplanets. I am co-PI of the ACCESS survey which is using Magellan@LCO to get transmission spectra for a sample of transiting exoplanets. I am also very interested as well in discovering and characterizing long period planets (P>10d) around nearby stars in order to characterize the densities of these systems whose structure is not affected significantly by the stellar flux. Finally, I am also co-leading efforts to discover giant planets around M dwarfs.

          I am a partner of <a href="http://obstech.cl">Obstech SpA</a>, a company that developed a new observatory from scratch in the north of Chile (more specifically in the RÃ­o Hurtado valley, our observatory, named "El Sauce", is about 26km south of Gemini). In this observatory we host currently close to 80 of telescopes. As part of this effort we have also developed some devices, such as all-sky cameras, and a telescope control system.
